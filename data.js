    title: `Man Utd 9-0 Southampton: How do Ralph Hasenhuttl's side recover again?`,
    excerpt: `'We lost again in a horrible way' - how do you recover from a 9-0 thrashing twice?`,
    body: `Up until the start of last season, only one team had ever been beaten 9-0 in the first 27 years of the Premier League.

    Now it has happened to Southampton twice in 16 months.
    
    Manchester United's 9-0 thrashing of the Saints on Tuesday came after Ralph Hasenhuttl's side were thumped by the same scoreline against Leicester in October 2019. United's 9-0 win over Ipswich Town in 1995 was the only other time it has happened.
    
    And, much like in the home defeat by Leicester, Southampton suffered an early setback at Old Trafford with a sending off, this time youngster Alexandre Jankewitz receiving a straight red card after only two minutes.
    
    Hasenhuttl and his side took on a recovery process after that humiliation at the hands of the Foxes, enduring reminders of the result in the build-up to a 2-1 win against the same opponent three months later, and facing up to questions on the one-year anniversary.
    
    They emerged stronger, it seemed, winning five of their first eight league games this season and being praised for their high-energy approach. Only four weeks ago they beat defending champions Liverpool 1-0.
    
    But now the rebuilding starts again...`,

    excerpt: `'I cannot tell you where the contact is' - Arteta considers Luiz red card appeal`,
    body: ` Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta criticised the referee's decision to send David Luiz off in the loss to Wolves and said the Gunners may appeal the ban.

     The Gunners were 1-0 ahead when Luiz was judged to have fouled Willian Jose and, because there was no attempt to play the ball, Luiz, 33, was dismissed.
     
     Ruben Neves scored the resulting penalty and Wolves won the game 2-1.
     
     "I've seen it 10 times in different angles and I cannot tell you where the contact is," said Arteta.
     
     However, Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo had a different view and said: "I think the referee doesn't have any other option in both situations."
     
     Arsenal led 1-0 thanks to a goal from Â£72m club record signing Nicolas Pepe, before the Luiz incident in first-half injury time. Daniel Podence played a through ball and Jose, on his home debut since joining Wolves on loan from Real Sociedad, got in front of Luiz, with the forward then going to ground...`,

    excerpt: `Time for Ireland to get to grips with Farrell's system`,
    body: `Andy Farrell's first task as Ireland head coach was to get his squad used to a new system.

      Doing that required a departure from the habits that had become second nature during Joe Schmidt's six-year reign.
      
      The hallmark of Joe's era was the attention to detail, everyone knew exactly what was expected of them at all times.
      
      If you're trying to break away from that and adopt a more off-the-cuff approach you need time together, because old habits die hard.
      
      There were some really strong habits formed under Joe but it was about manipulating the opposition from what we saw in the build-up to the game, whereas Andy is more about trying to play what's in front of you.
      
      The time Andy thought he had to implement those changes was cut short, because things more important than Ireland's continuity were happening in the world. Nonetheless, it is a significant mitigating factor, and should be considered when dissecting what we know about his time in charge so far.
      
      So what can we expect to see Andy do differently in 2021?`,

    excerpt: ` Blue Jackets lose Laine debut to Stars; Pavelski scores four points`,
    body: `COLUMBUS -- Joe Pavelski had two goals and two assists, and the Dallas Stars spoiled the debut of Patrik Laine with the Columbus Blue Jackets with a 6-3 win at Nationwide Arena on Tuesday.

    Laine and Jack Roslovic were traded by the Winnipeg Jets to the Blue Jackets for Pierre-Luc Dubois on Jan. 23. Laine played 20:54 and had two shots, two hits and was minus-2.
    
    "It was tough at the beginning," Laine said. "The legs weren't quite there. My head definitely was not there. My hands were not there.
    
    "And, obviously, a new system and new linemates. But I'm not here to make excuses. I think I wasn't at the level I need to be for this team to be able to win."
    
    Jamie Benn had a goal and two assists, John Klingberg had two assists, and Jake Oettinger made 23 saves for the Stars (5-1-1), who scored four times in the second period for a 5-1 lead.`,
